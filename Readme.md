### 📱 ✨ The smartphone's boutique (Phone Catalogue) ✨ 📱

### WHAT IS IT?

"The smartphone's boutique" is an online and sofisticated technology shop. Sofisticated because they just sell 8 smartphones.
<br>
This is part of the idea of creating a website with meaning, or some UX. It's provided a JSON file for doing this test.
Itself, it's meaningless. I mean, just info. So I had the idea of creating a small boutique and not simply develope a website that renders a JSON file.

### UX/UI

As I mentioned before, this website has been given the appearance of an online store. It is easy to use and intuitive. For this, a simple and clean interface has been developed. We do not want customers to run away from our website!
