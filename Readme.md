### 📱 ✨ The smartphone's boutique (Phone Catalogue) ✨ 📱

#### What is it?
"The smartphone's boutique" is an online and sofisticated technology shop. Sofisticated because they just sell 8 smartphones.
This is part of the idea of creating a website with meaning, or some UX. It's provided a JSON file for doing this test. 
Itself, it's meaningless, I mean, just info. So I had the idea of creating a small boutique and not simply develope a website that renders a JSON file.

#### Tech Stack
React/Redux, Hooks, Node, Express, Axios, Docker...

#### UX/UI
As I mentioned before, this website has been given the appearance of an online store. It is easy to use and intuitive. For this, a simple and clean interface has been developed. We do not want customers to run away from our website!

#### HOW TO RUN - API & FRONTEND APP
- 
- 
- 

#### DONE
- REST API: 1 endpoint, returns 'phones.json'...
- Front: Fetch data with Redux and Axios (or similar), display initial list with all phones, render phone details when clicked,responsive design...

#### TO DO
- Display spinner while request... 
- Repo: Public repo,  add readme that explains how to run... 
- Dockerize 
- Write realistic unit/end-to-end tests
