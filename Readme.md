### 📱 ✨ The Soamee Shop (Phone Catalog) ✨ 📱

### WHAT IS IT?

"The Soamee Shop" is an online and sofisticated technology shop. Sofisticated because they just sell 8 smartphones.
<br>
This is part of the idea of creating a website with meaning, or some UX. It's used a JSON file (which I use to own) for doing this test.
Itself, it's meaningless. I mean, just info. So I had the idea of creating a small shop and not simply develope a website that renders a JSON file.
